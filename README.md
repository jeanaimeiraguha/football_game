# footballgame


This is one of my projects I'm adding to my personal [portfolio that you can see here.](https://iraguha-jeanaime.netlify.app)

This is a football game I'm making using just JavaScript. To draw the field, the players and the ball I used the `<canvas>` element.
The HTML `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript. It's only a container for graphics. 
You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
